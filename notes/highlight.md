## Highlight

### Don't Understand
In addition, the system knows the depth of the target endpoint, so it could closely estimate turnaround time for handshake. In addition, the host controller knows the size of a handshake packet. Pre-computing effects of bit stuffing and summing up the other overhead numbers coujld allow the host controller to know exactly whether there was enough bus time, before EOF1 to complete the OUT transaction. To accomplish the particular approach takes an inordinate amount of time and hardware complexity.
